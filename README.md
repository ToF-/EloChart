Elo Chart

Printing the chart
------------------

I can display the chart with all players (Player Name, Elo) sorted by decreasing Elo rank.

Adding a new player

I can add a new player (Player Name). 
When I display the chart, the new player is displayed, with Elo rank = 1500.
The Player Name must not exist already in the chart.

Recording a match
-----------------
I can record a match between two players.
When I display the chart, the Elo rank of each player has been recalculated.
I cannot record a match between a player and herself.
I cannot record a match between players that are not in the chart.
